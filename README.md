# CryptoZombies

- Install: `npm install`
- Test: `truffle test`
- Deploy `truffle migrate --network rinkeby`

I followed the CryptoZombies tutorial to get an initial taste of Web3 development. I followed lessons 1-6, 11, and 10 in that order. Ultimately I deployed the project to the Rinkeby test network but don't have the frontend code hosted anywhere, so in its current state, this is more of a learning exercise than a finished product.

NOTE: [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69984326/solidity-time-travel-test-failing/69989325#69989325) helped me get to a fully green test suite :)
